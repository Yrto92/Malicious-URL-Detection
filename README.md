# Malicious-URL-Detection

Malicious websites are a known threat, which are used by perpetrators to control victimsâ€™ machines or get their data remotely. It is difficult and nearly impossible to identify the threat just by looking at the URL, or even more so, when the link to the site is encoded by a QR code. In an attempt to find a solution to this problem, this work aims to detect malicious links by way of classifying URL strings and by analyzing URLs embedded in 2D (QR) codes.
